# Take-home exercise for backend candidates at Promptly

Build the API to allow for the anonymous creation/taking of questionnaires.

Ideally you will use either Python, PHP, NodeJS. You may use another language/platform (e.g., Java, .Net) if you so choose, but please be aware it will take us significantly longer in that case to get back to you with feedback.

## General

* Please include a README with instructions on how to run it. 
* Use whatever libraries you like. 
* Extra points for simplicity
* The easier to set-up and understand the better
* You will need to persist the data in some way. 
* But think about how you would want to do it in production and write up (one paragraph) how you would do it. 

## Specifications:

API Should Support:
* Creating a questionnaire
* Taking a questionnaire
* Deleting a questionnaire
* Getting Results of a questionnaire
* A questionnaire should consist of questions and each question should have yes/no (true/false) answers
* We should get a comparative result from last answered questionnaire.

Note: no frontend is needed and any submitted will not be part of review.
